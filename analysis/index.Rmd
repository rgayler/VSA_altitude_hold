This is the website for the research project "VSA Altitude Hold".

If you have cloned the project to a local computer this website is
rendered in the `docs` subdirectory of the project directory.

If you are using `workflowr` to publish the research website it will
also be rendered online to GitHub Pages.

This page acts as a table of contents for the website. There are links
to the web pages generated from the analysis notebooks and to the
rendered versions of any manuscripts/documents/presentations.

# Overview documents {.unnumbered}

## [Design Notes](design_notes.html) {.unnumbered}

This notebook is for keeping notes about potential approaches for implementing altitude hold in VSA.

# Publications {.unnumbered}

Links to rendered manuscripts and presentations will go here.

# Empirical Notebooks {.unnumbered}

Links to notebooks recording empirical work will go here.

This project repository deals with the conceptual issues of using VSA for altitude hold.
Actual implementation occurs in the [gym-copter][] repository
So the empirical work in this repository is limited to exploration of VSA-specific issues.
