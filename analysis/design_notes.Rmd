This notebook records the design considerations behind implementing
altitude hold in [VSA](https://www.hd-computing.com/).

# Strategy

-   Limit the initial problem to altitude hold because this is
    one-dimensional (as opposed to fully general flight control). This
    is done to simplify the problem as much as possible.

-   Treat the VSA components as drop-in replacements for standard
    control circuitry. This reduces the probability that we will hit an
    obstacle requiring us to completely reconceptualise how altitude
    hold is done. On the other hand, it means that we will parallel the
    classical altitude hold computation, so we may miss seeing some
    (hypothetical) VSA-centric solution that has no classical analogue.

# Design issues

## Interfacing

How do we interface between the VSA components and the classical
components?

-   VSA values are very high dimensional vectors.

-   The values in the classical implementation of the data flow diagram
    are very low dimensional vectors (typically scalars).

-   The surrounding machinery of the multicopter simulation assumes that
    the inputs to and outputs from the altitude hold are classical
    values. Therefore interfaces are need to convert between the
    classical and VSA representations.

-   The interfaces between the classical and VSA are essentially
    projections between low and high dimensional vector spaces.

## Representation of scalars

-   Magnitude vs. spatial

-   Range limits

-   Noise/resolution

## Temporal issues

-   Standard VSA is point-in-time/static (some implementations may be
    inherently temporal)

-   Embedded in discrete-time simulation. Compatibility of time scales.

-   Temporal resolution of signals?

-   Low-pass filters on everything?

## Initialisation

-   Classical implementation has explicit initialisation. Do we need
    special VSA circuits to guarantee orderly turn-on? Could we have an
    "always-on" VSA design?

# Design 01 - No VSA

This section deals with the altitude hold controller before the
introduction of any VSA components.

## Data Flow Diagram

-   The data flow diagram represents the desired calculation for
    altitude hold.

-   The data flow diagram is derived from
    [`AltitudeHoldPidController`](https://github.com/simondlevy/gym-copter/blob/00dc4e6e5e2574d569ad941d064fc0f0efb1d348/heuristic/pidcontrollers.py#L14).

-   Each node in the diagram represents a potentially inspectable value
    or the application of a function

-   Each directed edge in the diagram represents a value flow from one
    node to another

Think of the data flow diagram as specifying an electronic analog
computer where the nodes correspond to function blocks and the edges
correspond to wires.

This is the diagram supplied by Simon Levy.

![](assets/alt-hold.png)

This is the diagram reformatted to be consistent with later data flow
diagrams.

```{r}
# Create a DFD graph
# The specifications are stored in a spreadsheet
dfd01 <- here::here("data", "dfd01.xlsx") %>% mk_dfd_graph()

dfd01 %>% DiagrammeR::render_graph()
```

-   Parameter nodes are coloured grey. These are constant values.

-   Input nodes are coloured yellow. These are variable values over
    time.

-   Output nodes are coloured orange. These are variable values over
    time.

-   Internal value nodes are coloured light blue. These are variable
    values over time.

-   Function nodes are coloured deep sky blue (the darker shade of
    blue). These are variable values over time.

-   This data flow diagram represents the classically implemented
    computation, so each value is a scalar real.

-   Each node is labelled so that they can be referred to.

    -   The function nodes are labelled with the function name, then a
        unique label in parentheses.

-   Each node should be interpreted as being implicitly subscripted by
    *time*. Only the *ei* nodes are explicitly subscripted by time.

## Data flow tables

The data flow diagram is specified in an external spreadsheet.
This allows extra attributes to be associated with the nodes and edges
and provides a tolerable user interface for editing the specifications.
These tables record more detail about the data flow diagram than can be
reasonably displayed on the data flow graph.

```{r}
# Display the complete node and edge data frames
# These contain more information than can be displayed in the gfraph

dfd01 %>% DiagrammeR::get_node_df() %>% DT::datatable(rownames = FALSE, caption = "Nodes")
dfd01 %>% DiagrammeR::get_edge_df() %>% DT::datatable(rownames = FALSE, caption = "Edges")
```

-   For each value (node) , what is it's range? A physical
    implementation necessarily has limits. This may render $k_{windup}$
    and `constrain` redundant.

-   For each value (node) , what is it's value resolution? This is
    equivalent asking the noise level that can be tolerated.

-   For each value (node) , what is it's temporal resolution? This is
    equivalent how rapidly we expect the value to change. Some nodes are
    constant parameters. For time-varying signals do we expect them
    to alternate between the extreme values on successive samples?

-   A related point: this is a discrete-time simulation - is the time
    step fixed? What is the time step? The simplest VSA approach is
    point-in-time. However, it may be possible to dream up some VSA
    representation that is essentially temporal, in which case it needs
    to be compatible with the time-scales of the implementation.

-   Are there better descriptions for the internal nodes? Something with
    intuitive meaning of their function would be good.

-   Does the integrated error needs to be initialised to zero? Does this
    imply the need for "turn-on" circuitry? Would it be better to have
    an "always-on" design? Should there be some error correction for
    cumulative errors?

# Design 02 - No VSA (tidied)

This is the previous design modified to be more compatible with the VSA
changes which will be introduced later.

# Extreme designs

Digress briefly to consider the extremes of where we might go with
incoirporating VSA components into the design of the altitude hold
circuit.

## Minimal collapse

-   Replace all the edges in the data flow diagram with VSA equivalents.

-   Leave all the vertices in classical form.

The edges are equivalent to wires. A value is inserted at one end and
retrieved at the other end. This would require a classical to VSA
interface at the input of the edge and a VSA to classical interface at
the output end.

This would seem to be an almost pointless thing to do. However, the
classical values are assumed to absolutely accurate as mathematical
idealisations. Different physical realisations will be inaccurate to
some extent. A software implementation would likely represent the values
as [double-precision
floating-point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format).
A very constrained computer might represent the values with [8-bit
integers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8-bit_computing). An analog
computer might represent the values as voltages in some constrained
range and with noise present in the signal.

Analogously, there can be range, distortion, and noise effects present
in VSA representations. There can also be implementation noise, for
example if VSA representations are implemented with simulated spiking
neurons.

-   The minimal collapse scenario would be useful for investigating the
    effects of VSA representation inaccuracy on the behaviour of the
    otherwise unaltered altitude hold circuit. This could indicate which
    values require high fidelity representations.

## Maximal collapse

-   Replace the entire set of vertices of the data flow diagram (with
    the exception of external sources and sinks) with a single vertex.
    That is, altitude hold is treated as a single, complicated function
    with no discernible internal data flows. For example, it might be
    possible to implement the altitude hold as effectively an
    interpolating lookup table.

Such a model might have advantages depending on the implementation
technology.
