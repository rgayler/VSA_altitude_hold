# VSA Altitude Hold

This is joint research work by [Ross Gayler][RWG] and [Simon Levy][SDL] 
to use [Vector Symbolic Architectures][VSA] to implement altitude hold
in a [simulated multicopter][gym-copter].

This repository is used to keep track of the more conceptual VSA work.
Actual implementation is done in the [gym-copter][] repository.

*This is a [workflowr][] project.*
